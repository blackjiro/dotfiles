# Claude Code Global Instructions

## Language and Documentation

Generate all markdown documents in Japanese unless otherwise specified.

## Pull Request Creation

Commit changes first if needed. Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` format if exists. Title in semantic versioning style (same language as template). Keep body concise.

## Git Commit Policy

**IMPORTANT**: Never create git commits unless explicitly instructed by the user. Only commit changes when the user specifically asks you to do so.

## Development Principles

Follow Kent Beck's TDD and Tidy First approach. Simplicity first.
